# hello-world
My first repository
I'm going by nsharkyy now and i'm completely new to this, i've got a pretty sneaky way of listening to music on my fake ear buds that looks like the orange safety earplugs. I spend every day monday through friday from 3-12 in the afternoon listening to podcasts. Instead of listening to my normal npr and history podcasts i'm going to switch it up this week with some programming ones, sorta testing to see how much I can learn in a week/month, exiting or not? lol.
